### Branch offices the fast and furious way

## Firewalls + azure ROPC.
I found this cute possibility, still to be confirmed, tested, approved, etc... of connecting a coworking space firewall directly to the azure identify service.
This way you allow poeple going to a coworking to authenticate against directy to the conpany cloud environment.
Just like you can join users PCs to AAD.

What does a solution like this offer in terms of TimeToImplement of a remote branch office?
