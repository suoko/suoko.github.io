# BRUNCH: CHROMEOS FOR ANY PC

Installing brunch, a kind of chromeos distribution, is not that difficult.
If you want to try it in a small partition next to windows, you just have to create a small dedicated partition for it and install grub2win to manage its boot.
The most generic iso is called rammus, so keep this name in mind when you're asked to choose the image version.
