# e-power for trucks

## CO2 ppm is going high

E-people are testing the new transportation ⛽️ in its electric form but consumer transportation can probably considered nuts compared to heavy duty transport vehicles. Huge battery packs are not gaining traction in the e-world, the money for fuel is little to no relevant, goods is what make the commerce-world spin. E-power should be tested, and imo could easily be already implemented: it shouldn't be that difficult and not that expensive. That's one of the root cause of the continuous ppm rise. Someone is re-activating old train routes, e-power can also help that with hybrid solutions such as siemens e-highway, if it will be necessary.

We are at 419, while 600 ppm is the limit, rumours say. It's still not clear what we'll experience after that.

I'm just waiting for people to become as expert in co2 levels and electric energy as they "have all" become now in virus and vaccines.
