# e-power for trucks

## CO2 ppm is going high

E-people are testing the new transportation â›½ in its electric form but consumer transportation can probably considered nuts compared to heavy transport vehicles.
Huge battery packs are not gaining traction in e-world, money and fuel is relatively relevant, goods is what make the commerce-world spin.
E-power should be tested, and imo could easily be already implemented: it shouldn't be  that difficult and not that expensive.
That's one of the root cause of the continuous ppm rise.
Someone is re-activating old train routes, e-power can help that with hybrid solutions.
