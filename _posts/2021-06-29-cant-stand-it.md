### A few more years

Years are known for making people less prone to stand others, but in this case it's not a question of years.
You have the 'cities' which are collectively taking a piss of some single persons (whether it's the country capital city, or the main 'car manufacturing' one). You have groups of people aggregated the way you prefer, who do the same.
You have other-races groups who also 'rage' against single ones.

'We don't want yours!!!'
Your habit, you son, your way, your voice, your non-religion, your whatever.

I just thought it could have started much later, but I should know the close-way takes you there in a while: and it's not easy to defeat.
