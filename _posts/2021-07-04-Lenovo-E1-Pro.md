### A full optional smartwatch

A 30â‚¬ Smartwatch with the usual sport modes, plus blood pressure and SPO2 sensors, (elderly gadget ?) and it's 50 meters deep waterproof.
It has no reflective screen like the amazfit bip so no 30 days battery life guaranteed, but it will stay alive for more than a week.
It won't even transmit the measurements triggered from the phone, the app will remember only those started from the app itself.

Pretty satisfied
