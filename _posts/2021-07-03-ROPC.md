### Branch offices the fast and furious way

## Firewalls + azure ROPC.

I found this cute possibility, still to be confirmed, tested, approved, etc... of connecting a coworking-space firewall directly to the azure identify service.
This way you allow poeple going to a coworking office to directly authenticate against to the company cloud environment.
Just like you can join users PCs to AAD.

What does a solution like this offer in terms of TimeToImplement of a small remote branch office? 
These offices used to remotely train people around the globe can be a good compound to remote and standard education.
